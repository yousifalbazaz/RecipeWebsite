                                <li>Place the marinated chicken pieces on a lined baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. You can also grill the chicken for a smoky flavor.</li>
                                <li>Optional step: If you want charred edges, broil the chicken for an additional 2-3 minutes. Set the chicken aside once cooked.</li>
            
                                <li><strong>Step 3: Prepare the Masala Sauce</strong></li>
                                <li>In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of butter or oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                                <li>Add the ground cumin, ground coriander, garam masala, paprika, and chili powder (if using). Cook the spices for 1-2 minutes, allowing the flavors to bloom.</li>
                                <li>Stir in the tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
                                <li>Pour in the heavy cream (or coconut milk for a dairy-free option) and simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with salt and sugar (if needed).</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 4: Combine Chicken and Sauce</strong></li>
                                <li>Stir the baked or grilled chicken pieces into the masala sauce, ensuring they are fully coated.</li>
                                <li>Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for another 5-10 minutes on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</strong></li>
                                <li>Top with fresh cilantro for an added burst of flavor.</li>
                                <li>Enjoy your Chicken Tikka Masala with warm naan or basmati rice!</li>

                        <li>Once the butter has melted and the mixture is hot, add the minced garlic.</li>
                        <li>Sauté the garlic for about 1-2 minutes, or until it becomes fragrant and turns golden brown. Be careful not to let it burn, as burnt garlic can taste bitter.</li>
